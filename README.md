# Claude Tutor - Python & Git 

## About This Repository

This repo documents my experiment with learning Python and Git for Identity and Access Management (IAM) automation with Claude as my tutor. 

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, control flow, loops
- **Data Structures**: Lists and dictionaries for managing user data
- **Functions**: Writing reusable, modular code
- **Version Control**: Git workflow with meaningful commit messages
- **Professional Development**: Building a portfolio with documented projects

## Projects

### 1. First Script (`first_script.py`)
Introduction to Python variables and print statements using IAM-relevant examples.

### 2. Access Checker (`access_checker.py`)
Conditional logic for determining user access levels based on role and account status.

### 3. User Database (`user_database.py`)
Working with lists and dictionaries to manage multiple users and their attributes.

### 4. User Functions (`user_functions.py`)
Reusable functions for user validation and data formatting.

## Goals

- Build practical automation scripts for IAM workflows
- Create a portfolio demonstrating Python and Git proficiency
- Develop DevOps/Infra automation skills

## Learning Resources

This learning path was designed by Claude through personalized, Socratic-style tutoring focused on hands-on practice and real-world IAM applications.
